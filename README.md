#RESTful API Implementation Overview

#Introduction:
This document provides an overview and rationale behind the implementation of a RESTful API for managing entities. The API allows performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities, with additional features such as filtering, searching, and error handling.

#Models:
#IEntity Interface
The IEntity interface defines the basic structure of an entity.
Properties include lists of addresses, dates, names, gender, deceased status, and an identifier.
Using an interface allows flexibility in implementing different entity types while ensuring common Properties:

#Entity Class
Implements the IEntity interface.
Represents an entity with its properties: addresses, dates, names, gender, deceased status, and an identifier.
By utilizing class inheritance, this ensures adherence to the defined interface and consistency across entities.

#Address, Date, Name Classes
Represent individual components of an entity (e.g., address, date, name).
Encapsulate relevant information for each component.
These classes help in organizing and structuring entity data efficiently.

#Repository
#EntityRepository Class
Simulates the database interaction layer with an in-memory collection _entities.
Provides methods for CRUD operations on entities.
Methods include GetEntities, GetEntityById, AddEntity, UpdateEntity, and DeleteEntity.
Utilizes LINQ queries for querying entities based on various criteria.

#Controller
#EntitiesController Class
Acts as the entry point for handling HTTP requests related to entities.
Uses dependency injection to inject an instance of EntityRepository into the constructor.
Implements HTTP endpoints for CRUD operations and additional functionalities like searching and filtering.
Each endpoint corresponds to a specific HTTP method and performs the corresponding operation.
Utilizes action attributes (HttpGet, HttpPost, HttpPut, HttpDelete) to define the HTTP methods and routes.
Incorporates parameter binding for query parameters and route parameters to facilitate data retrieval and manipulation.

#Endpoints
GET /api/Entities: Retrieves a list of entities with optional filtering, searching, and pagination.
GET /api/Entities/{id}: Retrieves a single entity by its identifier.
POST /api/Entities: Creates a new entity with the provided data.
PUT /api/Entities/{id}: Updates an existing entity with the provided data.
DELETE /api/Entities/{id}: Deletes an entity by its identifier.
Error handling is implemented to return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found) when necessary.

#Conclusion
This implementation provides a robust and flexible RESTful API for managing entities. By adhering to best practices and utilizing appropriate design patterns, it ensures scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. Additionally, the use of dependency injection, interfaces, and separation of concerns enhances code modularity and testability.
